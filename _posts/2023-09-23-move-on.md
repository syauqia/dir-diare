I guess it&#8217;s because of the nights you spent together talking about your dreams, his fear, your insecurities, the times he made you feel so happy that your lips ached from smiling so much. Maybe it&#8217;s because you felt safe around him. I think moving on from someone you thought would stay is hard because we never imagine any moment without them.

Maybe it&#8217;s because with him/her you felt you were at peace and even after he/she left,your heart was always clinging onto the last bit of hope that he/she would look back and see that you still cherished[^1] him.

You were still willing to put everything aside just to see him beside you.It's so hard to realize that the person you thought would never hurt you,suddenly became the very person to break your heart. I guess the worst part about doing away with his memories is realizing that he/she longer belongs here and you can&#8217;t even tell him how much it hurts.
